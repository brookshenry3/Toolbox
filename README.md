# KBH's Toolbox of bioinformatics tools

This repo contains a curated collection of my favorite/most used/useful bioinformatics-related tools, scripts, and other bits and bobs. I've tried to semi-organize it into language and use cases. HPC contains generic submission script templates for LSF, PBS, and Slurm.
