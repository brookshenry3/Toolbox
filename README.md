# KBH's Toolbox of bioinformatics tools

This repo contains a curated collection of my favorite/most used/useful bioinformatics-related tools, scripts, and other bits and bobs. I've tried to semi-organize it into language and use cases. HPC contains generic submission script templates for LSF, PBS, and Slurm. 

I have also tried to credit scripts/code that are not my own to their rightful creators. If I have used code that you have generated and would like credit for please feel free to message me and I will fix it.
